# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
### The goal of this project is to find the correlation between the altidude, number of strikes, total cost of damages, and species that were most affected.

## Process
### Select an option and file that was chosen for this project.
### Create your questions and how you will answer them.
### Find the correlation between the columns
### List the challenges within the project.
### Lastly, describe your future goals.

## Results

### Option 2, FAA WildLife Strikes was selected for this project.

### Which season did accidents occur most frequently?
### Used a bar graph to show the correlation between the months and amount of strikes.

### What caused the huge surge of accidents after 2009?
### Used a bar graph which gave me insights on the amount of planes running after 2009.

### Are the number of strikes correlated with the altitude?
### A line graph was used to show the correlation between dates/altitude/strikes, and a forecast was also used to adjust for the outliar year 2015.

### Which states were affected the most in terms of damage/strikes?
### A map was used with a parameter of Number of Strikes and Total Costs.

### Lastly, when did the accidents occur (Approach/Landing Roll/ Takeoff run) and which species were affected during the landing/takeoff?
### A bar graph with phase of flight and number of strikes was used to find out at which points the accidents were happening.

## Challenges 
### Biggest challange was the incomplete data, we didn't get a full year in 2015. Data stopped during May, which was less than half the year, a forecast was used to fix this outliar. Also, playing around with the parameters, I tried adding the number one species that had the most strikes within the map sheet where there was already a parameter for strikes and costs. I wanted to see if I can show the states and which species were affected the most within that state. It was hard trying to get around the error Tableau gives you on adding aggregate and non-aggregate functions within the calculated field. Sure I could of just did it on another map sheet, but that would of been a waste of space within the dashboard, it would of been far more affective within the parameter.

## Future Goals
### Have a complete understanding to get around such errors within the calculated field, and find better shortcuts within Tableau.
